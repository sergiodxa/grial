## Why?
There's a lot of boilerplate code required to run a GraphQL API with Node.js, the server code it's almost always the same, create a server, load the resolvers and the schema and set the `/graphql` endpoint along with GraphiQL.

Grial allow you to only think about your business logic and API and is responsible for implementing the boilerplate code for you.

Grial also provide you with connectors you can use to consume many data sources easily.
